# Horiseon Website Cleaned Up

This repository contains the website for Horiseon, cleaned up to use more semantic HTML and condensed CSS.

The website still looks as it originally did; style and layout were kept, but code was cleaned and made more accessible and is now better SEO optimized using semantic HTML.
